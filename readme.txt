Min Max Quantities for WooCommerce is an extension that enhances control over your sell. It enables you to set a special rule over the cart total and also the number of products. You can also set special rule for individual products too.


# Description

**[Min Max Quantities for WooCommerce](https://pluginever.com/plugins/woocommerce-min-max-quantities-pro/)** is the simplest WooCommerce extension to create special deals with product quantity and price. With the help of this plugin, customers are only allowed to purchase a prededined minimum and maximum product quantity and/or amount.

**Min Max Quantities for WooCommerce** stands out with its easy to follow features. It will allow you to set a rule that applies to every single product of your store. Besides, you can set quantity and price threshold for single products as well as variable products. Moreover, the plugin also allows you to restrict the product quantity and price on the cart page.

These brilliant features will empower you to restrict your customers from purchasing an item if the product quantity and price conditions are not met. For instance, if you set a minimum and maximum product quantity for a product, customers will not be able to check out if they attempt to purchase a quantity that is lower than the minimum or higher then the maximum you have set. Likewise, you can also set a minimum and maximum range for the product price. Provided that, customers must pass those conditions for successful checkout.

The basic rules are applicable storewide. By default, they include all products of your store. You can also exclude an individual product from the storewide rule or set a custom rule by using the option named ***Exclude Min/Max Rules***. Apart from that, you can also target the ***cart*** and set conditions targetting it.

**How can I suggest a new feature?**
We would love to hear your suggestions! Feel free to open a new issue [here](https://github.com/pluginever/wc-minmax-quantities/issues) as the feature request.

**What if I set the min-max product quantity or price value to zero?**
Setting Min-Max product quantity or price to zero will not function as rules.

**What is quantity step or step count?**
If your customers want to purchase a product, the minimum quantity of the product will be shown on the single product page and the cart page by default. If the customer intends to increase the product quantity from the product page or in the cart, it will increase collectively.

**How can I override global settings with a single product min-max condition?**
From the product page, go to general settings and select override global settings, and put values where necessary.

**How to ignore global Min-Max rules?**
From the product page, go to general settings and select ignore min/max rules, and doing so, it will abrogate all min/max rules for the product.

**Can I set the min-max rule for the variable products?**
Yes, for the parent product, you can set the min/max quantity rule. You can choose any number of variations within the given condition in the parent product.

**Does the cart have a separate min/max rule?**
Yes, you need to set a separate cart rule from the settings, and it will act globally. Whatever min/max rule you are setting either global or productwise, eventually, the cart rule will be dominant.

**What if I do not set the cart rule?**
If the global rule or the product rules are set the cart will maintain the global or product rules if the cart rule is not set.
