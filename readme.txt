WC Min Max Quantities for WooCommerce is an extension that enhances control over your sell. It enables you to set a special rule over the cart total and also the number of products. You can also set special rule for individual products too.

 
== Description ==
Min Max Quantities for WooCommerce is the simplest WooCommerce extension to create special deals with product quantity and price. You will be able to set a minimum and maximum allowable product quantity and/or price that can be purchased for each product storewide, or just for an individual product. Moreover, you will be able to set additional global restriction by setting a minimum and maximum limit on the cart total. 

Min Max Quantities for WooCommerce offers brilliant functionalities that are very straightforward to use. It will enable you to restrict customers from purchasing an item if the product quantity and price conditions are not met. For instance, you can set conditions for the products of your store by setting a minimum amount and a maximum amount. The customer will not be able to check out if they attempt to purchase an amount that is lower than the minimum or higher than the maximum. You can also set minimum and maximum product prices along with the quantity. A customer must pass the two conditions for successful checkout.

Apart from the global rule that is applicable storewide for each product, you can set custom rules for individual products with the option to ignore the global rule. On top of the product level conditions, you can also set a condition that will be applicable for the cart total. This will force the customer to purchase a total number of products based on your preference.
