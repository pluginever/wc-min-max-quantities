**What if I set the min-max product quantity or price value to zero?**
Setting Min-Max product quantity or price to zero will not function as rules. 

**What is quantity step or step count?**
If your customers want to purchase a product, the minimum quantity of the product will be shown on the single product page and the cart page by default. If the customer intends to increase the product quantity from the product page or in the cart, it will increase collectively.

**How can I override global settings with a single product min-max condition?**
From the product page, go to general settings and select override global settings, and put values where necessary.

Yes, for the parent product, you can set the min/max quantity rule. You can choose any number of variations within the given condition in the parent product. 

**Does the cart have a separate min/max rule?**
Yes, you need to set a separate cart rule from the settings and it will act globally. Whatever min/max rule you are setting either global or productwise, eventually, the cart rule will be dominant.

**What if I do not set the cart rule?**
