== Description ==

**[Min Max Quantities for WooCommerce](https://pluginever.com/plugins/woocommerce-min-max-quantities-pro/)** lets set required minimum and maximum order quanlities or amounts in WooCommerce. You can set quantity and price thresholds for simple products as well as variable products. You can also set conditions targetting the cart.

These brilliant features will empower you to restrict your customers from purchasing items if the product quantity and price conditions are not met. For instance, if you set a minimum and maximum product quantity for a product, customers will not be able to check out if they attempt to purchase a quantity that is lower than the minimum or higher then the maximum you have set. Likewise, you can also set a minimum and maximum range for the product price. 

=== ‚ú® THE BENEFITS OF MIN MAX QUANTITIES FOR WOOCOMMERCE: ===

* If you are not capable of delivering a product more than certain quantity, you can set a maximum order quantity or amount so that customers can not purchase a product if the quantity is more than the maximum.
* Some products can be sold only in certain quantities for the packaging purpose, you can set a quantity group so that customers can not purchase the product other than the predefined quantity group.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which min/max rule takes priority over the other? =
There are multiple levels of min/max rules that you can assign to your products. The rules have a hierarchy to prioritize one rule over the other. Find below the priority of min/max rules from high to low:

‚è´ Product variation. [Premium]
‚è´ Product.
‚è´ Category. [Premium]
‚è´ Global

= How can I suggest a new feature? =
We would love to hear your suggestions! Feel free to open a new issue [here](https://github.com/pluginever/wc-minmax-quantities/issues) as the feature request.

= What if I set the min-max product quantity or price value to zero? =
Setting Min-Max product quantity or price to zero will not function as rules.

= What is quantity step or step count? =
If your customers want to purchase a product, the minimum quantity of the product will be shown on the single product page and the cart page by default. If the customer intends to increase the product quantity from the product page or in the cart, it will increase collectively.

= How can I override global settings with a single product min-max condition? =
From the product page, go to general settings and select override global settings, and put values where necessary.

= How to ignore global Min-Max rules? =
From the product page, go to general settings and select ignore min/max rules, and doing so, it will abrogate all min/max rules for the product.

= Can I set the min-max rule for the variable products? =
Yes, for the parent product, you can set the min/max quantity rule. You can choose any number of variations within the given condition in the parent product.

= Does the cart have a separate min/max rule? =
Yes, you need to set a separate cart rule from the settings, and it will act globally. Whatever min/max rule you are setting either global or productwise, eventually, the cart rule will be dominant.

= What if I do not set the cart rule? =
If the global rule or the product rules are set the cart will maintain the global or product rules if the cart rule is not set.
