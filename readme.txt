== Description ==

**[Min Max Quantities for WooCommerce](https://pluginever.com/plugins/woocommerce-min-max-quantities-pro/)** allows you to specify the minimum and maximum order quantities or amounts in WooCommerce. You can set quantity and price thresholds for both simple and variable products. You can also specify conditions that apply to the cart.

These amazing features will allow you to restrict customers from purchasing items if the product quantity and price conditions are not met.

For example, if you specify a minimum and maximum product quantity for a product, customers will be unable to check out if they try to purchase a quantity that is less than the minimum or greater than the maximum. Similarly, you can specify a minimum and maximum price range for the product.


=== ‚ú® THE BENEFITS OF MIN MAX QUANTITIES FOR WOOCOMMERCE: ===

* Some products are only profitable when purchased in bulk; otherwise, you lose money. You can eliminate unprofitable orders by establishing a minimum order quantity or amount.
* If you are unable to deliver more than a certain quantity of a product, you can set a maximum order quantity or amount so that customers cannot purchase a product if the quantity exceeds the maximum.
* Some products can only be sold in specific quantities for packaging reasons; you can set a quantity group so that customers cannot purchase the product in any quantity other than the predefined quantity group.
